## Sentiment Analysis of Airline News Sources

<p>I work as a developer for a major airline which is currently going through a technology transformation. As part of this transformation, one question that was recently posed was, "How does our technology stack compare to other airlines?" After some discussion it was decided that there was no real way to know. However, in this conversation it was thought that certain airlines had a reputation for being more technologically advanced and reporting more on technology. This got me thinking about how different airlines are reported on and how this reporting impacts public opinion.<br>
To try and answer these questions text and sentiment analysis was performed on a couple of popular travel websites that do reporting on major airlines. The goal was to use the written article and any available comments to try and find patterns or differences on how different airlines were reported on, and if this reporting had any impact on public opinion or sentiment.

## Data

<p>The text data for this project was scrpaed from two popular travel websites [The Points Guy](https://thepointsguy.com/) and [One Mile At A Time](https://onemileatatime.com/), with the focus being on three main airlines: American Airlines, Delta, and United. This project was limited to articles dating between January 1st, 2019 and January 31st, 2021. The data chosen to be scraped from each article, if available, was:<br></p>

- Date the article was published
- The author of the article
- Title of the article
- The tags of the article
- The article content or the writing of the article
- Any comments on the article if they are available
- The name of the site the data was scraped from
